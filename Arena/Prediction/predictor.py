    """
    The main object of the real-time prediction module, exposed to the other modules of the arena system.
    An object responsible for processing video frames into predictions of touch events.

    First, the video frame is passed to a Detector object which returns an array of bounding box detections
    of the Pogona head in the frame. The bounding box coordinates are then transformed to a coordinate system
    relative to the screen using the Calibration module. The transformed detections are added to an array of
    past detections (history attribute) and this data is passed to a TrajectoryPredictor that generates a trajectory
    forecast. From this trajectory forecast a hit prediction consisting of an approximate x coordinate of the hit
    (relative to the monitor resolution), and the number of frames until the predicted hit is generated.

    A hit is predicted when the bottom edge of the bounding box passes a certain y-coordinate threshold
    (prediction_y_threshold attribute).

    All trajectory forecasts are stored in the forecasts attribute (a list of forecast arrays) for later
    analysis if necessary.

    The history array grows dynamically as new frames are processed. The reset() method clears the history
    and should be used to prevent excess memory usage when running for a long time.
